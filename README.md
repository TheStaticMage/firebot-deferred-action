# Firebot Deferred Action

This is a [Firebot](https://firebot.app) plugin that schedules effect lists to run after a delay so you can time follow-up actions without writing custom timers.

## Features

- Schedule effect lists with configurable delays
- Group tasks and control conflicts (cancel, execute, keep existing; schedule, execute, or skip new)
- Cancel deferred actions by task ID
- Execute deferred actions immediately via effect or UI panel
- Emit events when tasks schedule, execute, or cancel, with matching replace variables
- Monitor deferred actions via a UI panel with run and cancel buttons

## Installation: Plugin

1. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (**Settings** > **Scripts**) if you have not already done so.
2. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-deferred-action/releases), download `firebot-deferred-action-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory (**File** > **Open Data Folder**, then select the "scripts" directory).
3. Go to **Settings** > **Scripts** > **Manage Startup Scripts** > **Add New Script** and add the `firebot-deferred-action-<version>.js` script.
4. Restart Firebot. (The plugin will _not_ load until you restart Firebot.)
